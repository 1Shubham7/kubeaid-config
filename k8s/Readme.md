# Cluster folders

This folder contains your cluster specific folder.
For eg, if you cluster name is `test.cluster.com` you should add a folder with that name in this directory.

We already support lots of [charts](https://github.com/Obmondo/k8id/tree/master/argocd-helm-charts), but if
you want to add more charts based on your need you can create a `argocd-helm-charts` folder here and add your charts
there.
